# Tiny Math Interpreter

A simple interpreter that can parse and evaluate basic mathematical expressions. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of how programming language interpreters work by breaking down the process into three main stages.

# The interpreter follows three main steps:
- Lexer (Tokenization)
- Parser (Syntax Analysis)
- Interpreter (Execution)

# How to run:
- install python then clone this repo:
  python3 intepreter_simple.py
